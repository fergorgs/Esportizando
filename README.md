# Esportizando

Esportizando is a mobile app created for the Campus Mobile competition, a brazilian nationwide contest that seeks to promote new 
ideas and the creation of new mobile solutions. See "screenshots" for some in app images.

We enrolled in the "Smart Cities" category. The app's main objective was to promote an increase in the number of people
that regularly practice sports in the big cities, given that Brazil is the 5th most sedentary country in the world. To achieve
that, we created an app that would function as a "sports' social network". Based on your profile and personal preferences, you 
would be recommended your "ideal" sports, and would be periodically presented with new sports that could interest you. The app also 
counted with a map that would show all nearby places where you could practice those sports. Users could also chose a place and a
sport and create an "event" that other interested users could enroll and participate.

Our app was one of the 16 selected among the over 50 proposals enrolled in the category. Over the course of one month, we got to develop
a fully functional prototype of the app, learn about entrepreneurship and innovation and get some great feedback from tech and entrepreneur
specialists.
